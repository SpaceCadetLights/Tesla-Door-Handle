# Tesla Door Handle
 This is the code for controlling a hacked tesla door handle. It runs on an esp32, and converts a tesla door handle into a home door handle that uses RFID to unlock or lock your home's door. 

 The tesla door handle has a 12v dc motor, limit switches, and a lovely pressure sensor so adapting it to control a home door just simply has to be done :) Using this code you can wire up your tesla door handle to an esp32, or any other microcontroller, and operate the handle using an RFID tag reader. Feel free to adapt this code to whatever application you like, I have developed it for the sole purpse of making my RV door waaaaay too futuric!
